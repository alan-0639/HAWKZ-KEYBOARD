# Basics - Custom Keyboard Structure and Design

The basic custom keyboard structure uses **Bottom Mount**, which is a type of **Case mount**.

  **Bottom Mount (Plate fixed to the bottom case)**: The internal assembly is fixed to the bottom case of the keyboard.
This structure is somewhat similar to Tray mount, but instead of being fixed inside the bottom case, it is secured to the edges of the bottom case. This allows for good flexibility in the middle, resulting in more extensive and uniform structural support. Additionally, this structure does not require a top case, enabling a floating keycap design. Personally, I find it slightly stiffer than Top mount.

- **Advantages**

The internal assembly is very securely fixed to the case, providing excellent consistency in typing feel.

- **Disadvantages**

The plate material significantly impacts the typing experience.
