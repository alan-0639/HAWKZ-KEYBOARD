# Basics - Architecture & Design

The basic custom keyboard architecture featured is a **Bottom mount**,  a type of **mounting style**.

  **Bottom Mount (Plate fixed to the bottom case)**: The internal assembly is secured directly to the bottom case of the keyboard.
This mount is somewhat similar to a Tray Mount, but instead of being fixed to internal stands, it's attached to the edges of the bottom case. This allows for a degree of flex in the central area, resulting in more extensive and uniform support from a rigid structural frame. Furthermore, this mount does not require a top case to function, enabling a floating keycap design. Personally, I find it feels slightly firmer than a Top Mount.

- **Advantages**

The internal assembly is firmly anchored to the case, providing excellent typing feel consistency.

- **Disadvantages**

The plate material significantly impacts the typing experience.
