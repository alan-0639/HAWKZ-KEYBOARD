This structure is somewhat similar to Tray mount, but instead of being fixed inside the bottom case, it is secured to the edges of the bottom case. This allows for good flexibility in the middle, resulting in more extensive and uniform structural support. Additionally, this structure does not require a top case, enabling a floating keycap design. Personally, I find it slightly stiffer than Top mount.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=" "></p><ul><li><strong>Advantages</strong></li></ul><p>The internal assembly is very securely fixed to the case, providing excellent consistency in typing feel.</p><ul><li><strong>Disadvantages</strong></li></ul><p>The plate material significantly impacts the typing experience.</p>',11)])])}const y=s(n,[["render",d]]);export{g as __pageData,y as default};
